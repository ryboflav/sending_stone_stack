#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to work with multiple Python versions; otherwise you might consider gitignore
#   all generated Python virtualenv files via:
.python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
